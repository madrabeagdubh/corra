Of ancient lands, where shadows dwell,
And whispers of the past do swell,
There rise the tales of Formorian might,
Eldritch beings, shrouded in night.

From darkened seas they once did come,
With eyes like embers, fierce and glum,
Their forms, a terror to behold,
Giants of strength, of ancient mold.

In battles fierce, their fury cast,
Against the Tuatha, spells were massed,
Yet still they stood with iron will,
Formorians strong, unbent, and still.

Balor of the Evil Eye,
With single glance could mortals fry,
A chieftain feared in every land,
His dread command, a ruthless hand.

But 'neath their harsh and cruel guise,
In secret hearts, a longing lies,
For lands to call their own, to till,
For peace amidst the tempest's thrill.

Yet in the annals of the brave,
Their stories echo, like the wave,
Of warriors bold and battles grand,
Of Formorians and their storied band.

So heed, ye sons of Erin's soil,
The tales of those who once did toil,
For in their legends, lessons gleam,
In courage found, and daring dream.

In times of yore, when shadows throng,
The Formorians' name resounds in song,
A testament to ancient might,
In Ireland's shadowed, storied night.
